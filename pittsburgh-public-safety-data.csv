"August 17, 2020",Arrest,All Zones,"During the August 15, 2020 “Civil Saturdays” demonstration in the city, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police arrested a protester at around 5 p.m. in Oakland. Matthew Cartier, 25, of Pittsburgh was subsequently charged with Failure to Disperse, Disorderly Conduct, and Obstruction of Highways and Other Public Passageways. Cartier was arrested by Pittsburgh Police officers in plainclothes, driving an unmarked police vehicle bearing municipal government license plates. Officers were wearing their police badges and identified themselves as Pittsburgh Police when they arrested Cartier. The arrest was made away from the main body of the protest which was stopped at an intersection about a block away. On Sunday, August 16, the Mayor’s Office and Public Safety held a news conference to address questions about the manner in which the arrest took place. During the news conference, Sergeant Donald Mitchell with the Pittsburgh Police Civil Affairs Unit, explained that Cartier was warned that he would be arrested if he did not stop unnecessarily blocking an intersection where there were no protesters. Mitchell said, “He refused, not on one occasion but on several occasions, saying that he does not listen to police.” Cartier was also earlier warned by another Motorcyle Unit officer to stop stepping in front of vehicles and directing traffic during the protest. Commander Ed Trapp, who heads the Special Deployment Division, explained why police effectuated what he called “a low-visibility” arrest of Cartier. “When high-visibility stuff takes place with these marches, it tends to attract a crowd and incite things further,” said Trapp. Pittsburgh Public Safety fully supports the right of peaceful assembly afforded to all Americans under the First Amendment. It will continue to balance those rights with the safety of all citizens during ongoing demonstrations in Pittsburgh. Mayor Peduto issued a statement today banning the use of such tactics during peaceful demonstrations.

No arrests have been made, but police continue to actively investigate. For more details, see the Public Safety Blotter: https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/blotterview/1074 Regarding the crash: A review of bodycam footage shows that as the first officers arrived on scene, one immediately called for EMS to be dispatched while a second officer told other officers that they had to get the victim out of the car. Together, they removed him from the vehicle, laid him on the ground and began performing lifesaving measures. They located the victim’s gunshot wounds and used tactical gauze to try to stop the bleeding. They quickly determined the victim was suffering from a sucking chest wound and applied a patch to his chest to remedy it, and did the same for a wound on his back. They used a bag valve mask to assist the victim’s breathing, and prepared to do CPR until EMS arrived and Medics took over. It should be noted that the driver of the second vehicle -- which rolled after the first vehicle crashed into it -- was an off-duty Pittsburgh Police detective who climbed out of the vehicle and joined fellow officers in rendering aid to the shooting victim.

However, the actions of a few protesters last weekend were unacceptable. Police are working with our law enforcement partners, including the US Attorney’s Office and FBI Pittsburgh, to investigate. Part of that process is collecting video evidence and attempting to interview witnesses. If laws were broken, charges will follow. Public Safety understand the desire to protest and will continue to respect and protect that right. But the public expects this department to uphold the law and we will follow that mandate. “People have the right to dine in public without being accosted and without vulgarities being thrown at them,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “What we saw this weekend was assault and battery. It was embarrassing. The vast majority of the protests in Pittsburgh have been peaceful, but this weekend was anything but peaceful.” “As a native Pittsburgher, what I saw this weekend was disturbing and cannot continue,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Sadly, the protesters’ message gets erased when you have certain organizers inciting violence, which is what a handful of them are doing. It creates a dangerous and volatile situation. Our goal, now and always, is to maintain safety for everyone, and that includes protesters, residents, visitors, business owners and patrons and our police officers who are working under difficult conditions to serve the public.”",Chris Togneri

"July 18, 2020",--,--,"It was with great sadness that Pittsburgh Public Safety observed the passing of Robert Full on July 17, 2020. Mr. Full began his public service as a first responder with the Forest Hills Fire Department in the early 1970’s. For 45 years, he also served the City of Pittsburgh (EMS), Allegheny County and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. “Bob was a mentor and a teacher to me,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “I’ve known Bob since I started my Public Safety career with Forest Hills in 1978. He was a leader. He was a well-known instructor in firefighting, rescue, and hazmat throughout the region. Bob Full was an incredible ally of Public Safety.” Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Assistant Chief Norman Auvil remembered Full as a close friend who was instrumental in creating the City’s Rescue and HazMat services. “He was absolutely focused on the mission at hand,” Auvil said. “Rescue, HazMat, EMS Medicine—he wanted nothing more than the best training and the best equipment for the people under his command. ... He was sincere. Quiet. Totally dedicated to whatever he was doing. He was just a good guy—one of those guys. You know, we all have priorities in life. Despite everything he accomplished in life, his priority was always his family.” “Bob Full was a leader in the city, county and state who was always an advocate for EMS and Public Safety,” EMS Chief Ronald Romano added. “He helped shape Rescue services and Hazard Materials training. He was an important figure who oversaw many advances in Public Safety.”",Chris Togneri

"June 14, 2019",Duckling Rescue,Waterworks,"Pittsburgh Animal Care & Control, with the help of passersby, rescued five ducklings that fell into a sewer in front of the Waterworks Cinemas on Friday. Animal Care & Control officers responded to the cinema around 9:30 a.m. after a man called 911 to report that he saw a duck and her ducklings walking through the parking lot, and that several ducklings fell through the wide openings of a sewer grate. Officers Duane Eagan and Jim Genco believed three ducklings were in the sewer. They removed the grate cover and lowered nets about eight feet to the sewer bottom. They lured the ducklings, who were hiding in sewer pipes, into the opening with popcorn from the cinema and by whistling. The first two ducklings emerged around 10:30 a.m. Genco put them in a cage and set it near bushes where the mother duck was last seen. They hoped the chirping of the ducklings would draw her back to the area. The last duckling was shy and refused to exit the pipe. So Eagan and Genco lowered the cage with the two ducklings back into the sewer to attract the third duckling. Dan McConnell, a technician with Fire Fighter Sales & Services – who was in the area to check extinguishers at the movie theater and who made the original 911 call – provided wire from his truck to help lower the cage. Within minutes, the third duckling emerged and Eagan caught it in his net and lifted it out of the sewer. The mother duck did not return, so Animal Care & Control took the three ducklings to Humane Animal Rescue Wildlife Center in Verona, where the ducklings will be fostered until they are ready to be released into the wild. But the story is not over ... Around 1:35 p.m., Animal Care & Control returned to the site after McConnell heard more chirping from the sewer and again called Public Safety. The officers removed the grate, set up the net and caught the final two ducklings, who were hiding in a different pipe from the first three ducklings. Those ducklings were taken to Verona to join their siblings. The rescue mission was aided not only by McConnell, but by passersby who helped remove the heavy grate, and Alcosan’s Charles Simone, who used a goose call to help draw the first three ducklings from their hiding place. Public Safety thanks everyone who pitched in to save the five ducklings. NOTE: For photos of the rescue, please see Public Safety's Facebook Page.",Chris Togneri
